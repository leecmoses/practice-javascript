        <div>
            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>array</strong> is one of the most useful data structures in JavaScript, at its core, an
                    array is just an <em>ordered</em> collection of elements, enclosed by square brackets</li>
                <li>Each element in an array is referenced by a <em>numeric key</em> called an <strong>index</strong>,
                    which starts from zero and increments by one for each additional element in the array</li>
                <li><strong>Objects</strong> is another very important data structure in JavaScript, fundamentally, it
                    is a collection of associated key/value pairs with curly brackets around it</li>
                <li>Unlike arrays, objects are <em>unordered</em> collections</li>
                <li>For object key names you'll commonly find quotation marks omited from property names, however
                    certain situations <em>require</em> them to be included, especially if the property name:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is a <strong>reserved word</strong> (e.g., for, if, let, true, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Contains <strong>spaces or special characters</strong> that cannot appear in a variable name
                        (i.e., punctuation other that <strong>$</strong>, and <strong>_</strong> -- most accented
                        characters)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>There are two ways to retrieve information from objects: <strong>dot notation</strong> and <strong>square
                        bracket notation</strong></li>
                <li>While dot notation may be easier to read and write, it can't be used in every situation, for
                    example if a key is a number or when variables are assigned to property names</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>2. Create and Modify Properties</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To create a new, blank object, you can use object <strong>literal notation</strong>, or the <strong>Object()</strong>
                    constructor function</li>
                <li>While both methods ultimately return an object without properties of its own, the <strong>Object()</strong>
                    constructor function is a bit slower and more verbose</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>As such, the recommended way to create new objects in JavaScript is to use literal notation</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Since objects are passed by reference, making changes to the copy has a direct effect on the
                    original object as well</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Invoking Object Methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>method</strong> is a property of an object whose value is a function</li>
                <li>Using <strong>this</strong>, methods can directly access the object that it is called on</li>
                <li>Note that <strong>this</strong> is a reserved word in JavaScript, and cannot be used as an
                    identifier (e.g. variable names, function names, etc.)</li>
                <li>The value of <strong>this</strong> is set when a method is invoked on an object, and that value <em>refers
                        to that object</em></li>
                <li>Arrow function expressions are special: they don't have their "own" <strong>this</strong>, instead
                    it takes from the outer "normal" function</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>4. Beware of Globals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How the function is invoked determines the value of <strong>this</strong> inside the function</li>
                <li>The <strong>window</strong> object is provided by the browser and is not part of the JavaScript
                    language or specification</li>
                <li>Since the <strong>window</strong> object is at the highest (i.e., global) level, an interesting
                    thing happens with global variable declarations</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every variable declaration that is made at the global level (outside of a function)
                        automatically becomes a property on the <strong>window</strong> object</li>
                    <li>Only declaring variables with the <strong>var</strong> keyword will add them to the <strong>window</strong>
                        object</li>
                    <li>If you declare a variable outside of a function with either let or const, it will not be added
                        as a property to the <strong>window</strong> object</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Any global function declarations are accessible on the <strong>window</strong> object as methods</li>
                <li>Avoid global variables and functions for two reasons, tight coupling and name collisions</li>
                <li><strong>Tight coupling</strong> is a phrase that developers use to indicate code that is too
                    dependent on the details of each other</li>
                <li><strong>Name collision</strong> occurs when two (or more) functions depend on a variable with the
                    same name</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A major problem wit this is that both functions will try to update the variable and or set the
                        variable, but these changes are overridden by each other</li>
                </ul>
                <li>There <em>are</em> times when you'll need to write global variables, but you should only write them
                    as a last resort</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>5. Extracting Properties and Values</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Object.keys()</strong> returns an array of the provided object's property names in the same
                    order as the elements would be when using a <strong>for</strong> loop</li>
                <li>Likewise, if we want a list of the <em>values</em> of an object, we can use <strong>Object.values()</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>6. Lesson Summary</h3>
            <ul>

            <ul>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>2. First-Class Functions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In JavaScript, functions are <em>first-class</em> functions, this means that you can do with a <em>function</em>
                    just about anything you can do with other elements, such as numbers, strings, objects, arrays, etc</li>
                <li>JavaScript functions can:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be stored in variables</li>
                    <li>Be returned from a function</li>
                    <li>Be passed as arguments into another function</li>
                </ul>
                <li>In many ways, a function in JavaScript can be treated as a <em>value</em></li>
                <li>A function that returns another function is know as <strong>higher-order function</strong></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function" target="_blank">First-class function</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>3. Callbacks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A function passed into another function as an argument is called a <strong>callback</strong>
                    function</li>
                <li>Array methods, such as <strong>forEach()</strong>, <strong>map()</strong>, and <strong>filter()</strong>,
                    take advantage of callbacks to execute functions onto a given array's elements</li>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype">Array Methods</a></li>
